### **Initiate a Loop for Color Array**

**Issue**: A mechanism to iterate over each color in your array is needed.

**Goal**: Craft a loop to iterate over your color array.

**Confirming You Succeeded**: Inside the loop, console.log `counter`. If you see numbers from `0` to the array's length minus one, you're doing well! Remove the log.

Here's a template:

```javascript
for (let index = 0; index < someList.length; index++) {
  // Loop body
}
```

Remember to replace `someList` with the name of your color array.

Here's a more refined example:

```javascript
for (let counter = 0; counter < sampleList.length; counter++) {
  // Your logic here
}
```

Adapt the loop to suit your needs.
