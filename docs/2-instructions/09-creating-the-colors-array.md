### **Create an Array for Your Palette Colors**

**Issue**: To efficiently generate the color palette programmatically, it's beneficial to have all our desired colors stored in one place.

**Goal**: In your JavaScript file, construct an array containing your list of colors. Each color should be represented as a string, using the standard CSS color names.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
An array in JavaScript is defined using square brackets `[]`, and individual items within the array are separated by commas.

<details>
<summary>Example Code</summary>

```javascript
let colorArray = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Remember, the colors provided are just placeholders. Replace them with the colors of your choice.

**Confirming You Succeeded**: To ensure your array is structured correctly, try logging it to the console. The result should be an array of color strings. After checking, remove the `console.log` statement for cleanliness!
