### **Initiate a Loop for Color Array**

**Issue**: To generate color divs, loop through a color array.

**Goal**: Craft a loop to iterate over your color array.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
A `for` loop should work well here.

Adjust the placeholder names.

```javascript
for (let counter = 0; counter < colorList.length; counter++) {
  // Your code here
}
```

</details>

**Confirming You Succeeded**: Inside the loop, console.log `counter`. If you see numbers from `0` to the array's length minus one, you're doing well! Remove the log.
